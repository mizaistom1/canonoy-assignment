        <h2>Why this place is special to me</h2>
        <p>
            It's amazing to see this natural phenomena that may look like some other worldy happenings 
            that is consistently occurring on another country specifically, Norway. It looks like the
            northern lights are coming from a sci-fi movie but it is in fact real. This is the reason why 
            I am so fascinated in this place.
