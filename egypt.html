        <h2>Why this place is special to me</h2>
        <p>
            This place is considered one of the seven wonders of the world and it is considered one for a reason.
            I do not think there's someone who can confidently explain how these pyramids are built by humans around
            2600 BC. There is no technology of some sort available at that time so it would be impossible to imagine
            that it is built by humans. This is the reason why I want to see it with my own eyes.
